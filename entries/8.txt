I want that peaceful life too.
The one with the stable job, stable home, stable love.
The one people dream about.
I want to build beautiful things in work and in life.

A beautiful piece.

A beautiful family.

A beautiful home.

We would've made some beautiful things.
It hurts that it ended so soon.
A part of me doesn't even think I can build it without you.
But I'll try anyways.

Maybe one day I can build it with you.
