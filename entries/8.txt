I want that peaceful life too.
The one with the stable job, stable home, stable love.
The one people dream about.
I want to build beautiful things in work and in life.
A beautiful piece.
A beautiful child.
A beautiful home.
We would've made some beautiful things.
It hurts that it ended so soon.
A part of me doesn't even think I can build without you.
But I'll try anyways.
