I have always been great at suppressing my feelings. 

I guess for a long time I thought that this would allow me to live in total bliss. 
To be free from the error of illogical human emotions and find solitude in the calm. 

However, this was illogical tool for the truth is that I am human too. 

I hide and run until I corner myself and let it all catch up to me. 
This instinct has even made me suppress my perception of others emotions as well, to think that they'll just turn it off as I do. 

However, everyone is different and some people- earnest people take the pain and aren't afraid to let the world see. 
In a way this is why I'm creating this- to fight my desire to run and instead stand here with my heart on my sleeve. 

The walls that once held me back are crumbling so that I can allow myself to feel again. 

The realization of how she must've felt in those times and the acceptance of how I felt in the months since has made me feel... alive. 

Alive because I can finally understand. 
Alive because I can tell everyone that this is my fault. 
Alive because I'm not afraid to shout to the world how you are the love of my life. 
Alive, because I'm no longer afraid to feel.
