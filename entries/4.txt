 I felt like- I feel like others see me as the mask I wore.
 The cool guy that everyone loves with a hint of chaos.
 Partly true but an exaggeration of something minor.
 This facade killed my relationship and much more.
 The desire for acceptance killed me.
 Drugs I never cared for.
 Friends that were no good for me.
 Cause deep down I'm just someone that loves staying home, working on my projects, and being at peace.
 Surrounded by plastic and became another mold.
 I am all my good parts and half of my bad.
 Anyways, she now think I'm some club-hopping player.
 The image of the real me gone.
 I only want to go out this Halloween cause she is.
 I wish she saw who I really am.
 I guess it was a good disguise.
 Fuck.
