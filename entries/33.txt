Thirty-three entries. I think this will be my last one for a while.
I took advantage of the downpour and went on a long walk. It was windy, wet, and brutally cold — but also isolated and peaceful. No one around to see.
I walked down the river path, listening to music and reflecting on the life I’ve lived.

I reflected on us — the amazing time we once shared, the years of connection that can never be replaced.
I reflected on you — realizing you’re probably gone for good, already beginning the chapter without me in it.
I reflected on myself — on how my disconnection led to this pivotal moment of agonizing epiphanies.

Life is short. Too short to stay trapped in the past, yet too short to sprint too far into the future.
I’m tired of running. So tired.

For months I tried to win you back in the only way I knew how — by running and ignoring what lay underneath.
For years I tried to find happiness the same way.

In the end, I only found a critical collapse.

As painful and scary as it is, I’ll break those rules and make new ones — fight the battles I created and stand my ground.

The only good thing running ever gave me was running into you. That’s the one thing I’d never change.

Our story may be over now, but if the chance ever comes for it to continue, you can bet my ass I’ll be there.
One more chance is all we'd need.

I love you, Izabella — and soon, I’ll love myself too.

This is my letter, my soul, my love, and my grief.

I think I’m better now.

I'm ready when you are.

I'm ready to come home.
