I've started some mma classes and working out again- rather aggressively. 
I find it to be a healthy output for my negative feelings, it's calming.

I don't think I've been eating enough though, gotta amp that up. 

Got some leads in pursuing a tech job too, let's hope I kill these interviews! 

What about you?

How's school?

I'm sure you're meeting a bunch of new people! 
And hey I must say that teachers are pretty cool- can't wait for you to finally be one! 

I wonder if you're happier now without me- or happier now because you're focused on you. 
I hope it's the second one haha. 

Any new crushes? 

Nah, can't ask that one.

Any new friends? 

Well that I am certain of!

Anyways, I think I'm slowly accepting that you left. 
I do think it's quite stupid but I'm not one to say what's good and what isn't anyways. 

My friends have told me that since you cut contact and blocked me on everything it probably means that you moved on and are open
to seeing other people and that I should do the same. 
Honestly though, nah- not my thing. 
I'd rather focus on me than risk that being clouded over a desire.

What do I know? 
Maybe I should try. 

I'd go up and talk to someone cause I was told to- only to reject them that same night. 
Isn't it funny how we humans function? 

Anyways, a part of me feels like someone else has infiltrated that beautiful mind of yours already- so I guess I should stop writing
this letter soon. 
The more I work on this, the harder it is to forget- but the easier it is to accept. 

Just don't end up with anyone that uses Discord.
