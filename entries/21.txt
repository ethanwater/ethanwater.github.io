I had to prepare myself the day I handed you your long awaited gift and letter.
I felt as if I was on autopilot- as if I can feel the eventual pain it will bring.

Before I went to your house I decided to calm myself at the park we used to always go to.

Remember those swings we used to ride on?

Well they were blocked away with caution tape.

It felt ominous and lonely.
So I sat on the bench instead.

Is this gods version of a joke?
