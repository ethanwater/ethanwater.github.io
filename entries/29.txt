“If i could do this all over again I would’ve never let you down. It was more fun when we did it together anyways. I love you felicity” “I love you too. But I should’ve never married you.”
If I were to cosplay anyone it'd be this guy. His lost-ridden drive to be Mr.Fantastic when in reality all he wants is a normal life and to be accepted by those around him. 
This was my curse too- my greatest obstacle. Losing you made me realize there is nothing fantastic about chaos, in fact i think the most fantastic things in my life were always from times of calm.
Funnily enough I find myself getting into cosplaying, been working on something with a friend of mine. I don't know yet if it's out of geniune interest or the deep urge to feel
free of the pressure I put onto myself. Either way, it'll either be this guy or Denji.
