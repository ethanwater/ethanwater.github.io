I never meant any of the cruel words I've said.
I lay here remembering all my bad moments.
The ones with you.
And it makes me feel sick.
To treat something so good with such rage is cruel.
It makes me nauseous.
What the fuck was I thinking?
Why is it that i'm only feeling the depth of this pain when you're gone?
Is it finally real?
I miss her.
I will never reach such anger again.
I cant afford the hurt it will cause.
If i could only speak to you one last time I'd tell you how amazing you truly are 
- my perfect image of love.
You deserved so much better than that.
I love you and it hurts.
Please god, help me never lose something so great again, and help me find true love within myself.
I'm so sorry.
I'll be better.
So this is my letter to you and public to the world. 
This is the cost of losing oneself over perfection, delusions, and emotional suppression.
I lay my guts here for all the see, so that others may find some peace within themselves.
And for the slim chance that I may see the love of my life again.
Thank you.
