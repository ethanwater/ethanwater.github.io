Is this the loneliness you felt? 
I wish my emotions were more in the present, perhaps then I would've grown. 

My emotions are always here or not. 
Not in the way of evil or good, but rather present or lost. 

I lose them to the future or the past. 
Preventing me from experiencing the present. 
Obsessed with the future. 

That obsession is what keeps killing it.
