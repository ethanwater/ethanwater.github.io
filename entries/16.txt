Is this the loneliness you felt? I wish my emotions were more in the present. Perhaps then I can finally grow. My emotions are always here or not. Not in the way of evil or good, but rather being present or lost. I never have no emotions but i do often lose them to the future or the past. Preventing me from experiencing the me in the NOW. I guess i'm a bit obsessed with the future. That obsession is what keeps killing it.
