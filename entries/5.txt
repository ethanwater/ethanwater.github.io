You were never boring.
I never thought you were.
Just another stupid word.
You were far from boring.
I'd love listening to you talk about- well anything.
I loved watching you dress and do your hair.
So beautiful you are.
Oh, and that wonderful creative mind.
Who else can turn such a small bedroom into the coziest room in the world?
Nothing was boring about you.
And even if you were I'd still love you.
If you're boring than I'm boring too.
And that's okay.
