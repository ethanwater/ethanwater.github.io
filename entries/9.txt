This old lady comes into my place of work sometimes.
Everytime she gives me a warm hug and a soft kiss on the cheek.
She is an artist.
Yet she always makes the same piece.
The same lines, same colors, same shape.
She has a fucked up leg- just left the hospital.
I told her that I've had a rough week too.
"We all get hurt sometimes" she said.
