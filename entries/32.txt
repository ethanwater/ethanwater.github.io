Hobbies. 

I realize that this is one of those secrets to recovering from heartbreak that actually work.

Some hobbies I've been thinking about/already started: kickboxing, creating and performing live music at lounges, 
gallery showings, meditation, rock climbing, acting classes, and freelance API development. 
Not only will it allow me to work on myself and meet like-minded people, it'll also help me get over you. 

Is that how you did it?

Both of which it seems that I need.
