Had my first dream in days.
You, your mom, sister, and best friend were at my home back in Jersey. Playful banter on the couch like you ladies would always do.
At some point you went over to the kitchen to ask why I wasn’t joining in on the conversation.
I told you that I was just taking in the moment.
We shared a warm embrace- my hands on your waist as you stood still and looked into me. 
I told you that everything will be alright. You said, "we’ll see". It felt so real- I remember every detail about you. 
Even the hold felt real- like I was really touching you.
I bet I was smiling in my sleep.
I miss you and your family deeply. I can never forget the home they gave me.
