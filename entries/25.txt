I'll be receiving my new bottle of medecine today (yay). I've also been looking at some apartments down in Jersey- I kinda fucking hate this city!
Still need to find a good therapist but I doubt it'll take long with all these new apps coming out. And hey, I'm even looking into some online colleges!
Being a sad fuck isn't gonna help me succeed but doing something about it will. In a way that's why I've been making this site- to heal.
