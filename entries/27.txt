I was able to fight to urge to call you last night. But I can’t fight the urge to do this. I love you and I miss you. I have been in pain everyday since we cut contact, I feel the pain you once felt. But there’s another pain much stronger- the fact that when you felt how I am feeling now, I couldn’t help you. I was so blind and nonchalant thinking that since we were together it was okay. I was loyal so I did my part. But the truth is that wasn’t going to work. I was stuck in my old ways albeit a bit more correct. But I never stepped outside of myself to think about what was truly going on underneath. I was naive but it was all I knew. I don’t want to give up on us, I still believe in us. But I know that I must give you the time you ask. But my god Bella does it hurt. I’ve never cried over a woman and I’ve never been this sad over one either. I just wish that I can hear you, see you, say hello to you but I can’t. You’re no doubt the love of my life and I wish I got my act together sooner. I truly am ready to drop everything the minute you say okay but I don’t know if you ever will. I miss my woman. This project is painful to produce, as every entry is a desire to reach out yet i can’t. I’m ready to come home. I want you back in my arms. Fuck taking over the world, I just want a happy life with you and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to do so. I mean that. I love you baby.
