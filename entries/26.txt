Just tell me you love me.
Im growing quite fast.
Im realizing my weaknesses and strengths.
I guess when you left the tide came over and forced me to drown.
Forced me to look into the mirror for once.
I will float back up again.
And this time Iâ€™ll be a better swimmer.
Would you like to swim together?
I'm just a train away.
