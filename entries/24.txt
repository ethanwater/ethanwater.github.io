Guess who I saw today? Dua Lipa. No kidding! She came into my coffee shop with her man and I made them a doppio espresso.
Shared some small talk and then went their seperate way. It was surreal. My first instinct was to run to the kitchen and give you a call.
But I knew better. Six months you said (but I'll be honest I don't want to wait that long). Anyways that was the first thing that made me smile this week.
Felt... reassuring.
