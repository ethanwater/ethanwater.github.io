No more running.
No more excuses.
I always wanted a degree and still do.
I always wanted a car- I miss my old one.
I always loved her- never wanted to lose her.
I always wanted to be a software engineer.
I let my failures define me with copious amounts of coping.
No more.
No more.
No more.
No more.
Like an immovable object.
