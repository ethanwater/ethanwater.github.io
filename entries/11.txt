"I don't love you anymore"
Did you mean that?
Is this why you asked for space before?
So that I can realize these things?
Whyâ€™d I have to wait til this.
Do you really mean that?
Is our romance dead?
It can't be true.
You must still love me that same way that I love you.
Atleast a part of you.
Did I play myself?
Were these past couple months a game to you?
Why did I play along.
Why didn't I listen?
If i did, I would've realized these feelings earlier and go about this the right way.
The earnest way.
I'd feel crushed if someone took my place.
I never meant for this.
I have to focus.
I must.
Fuck me, am I a softie?
