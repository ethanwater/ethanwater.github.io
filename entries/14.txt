The last time we met sucked.
I mean, what the fuck was I thinking?
The awkward silence and the desperate physical tension.
I was holding her as if nothing happened- it was terrible. 

My poor love. I should've just been confident and not depend on cheap tricks for her attention.
I didn't prepare my emotions. 
I wasn't even aware of them.
I tried to run back into it.

Now I see the fault. 
The error in my ways.

I just wish I saw it before this all broke down.
