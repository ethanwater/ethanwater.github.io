*"I have to re-create the universe every morning when I wake up. And I don't take things for granted. I store things in little cells in my head, like honeycombs. And every time I experience something, I feel like I am adding a cell to my head."*  

Bjork, Interview with *The Guardian*, 2001.

- The Method of Loci- Store memory into familiar spatial environments
- Chunking - Storing memory into individual chunks
- Graph Memeory - Visulizaing memory as a neural network
- Associative Memory - Free recall, dream logic, the random sprout of thought

Modularity, I believe, is the dna of creativity. Creation must be purposeful, otherwise the product is a transparent mesh fabricating what true creativity is. We are only shortly fascinated by the artifical, but we develop longings for the natural. Modular thinking is diificult. You have break what you know into little blocks, orchestrating them within their most your focused space.

Does this make sense? Fuck if I know.

I think the creative mind is able to break something apart and turn it into something new. 

The genius mind is able to find the connections between these scattered bits.
