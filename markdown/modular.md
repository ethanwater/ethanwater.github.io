*"I have to re-create the universe every morning when I wake up. And I don't take things for granted. I store things in little cells in my head, like honeycombs. And every time I experience something, I feel like I am adding a cell to my head."*  

Bjork, Interview with *The Guardian*, 2001.

- The Method of Loci- Store memory into familiar spatial environments
- Chunking - Storing memory into individual chunks
- Graph Memeory - Visulizaing memory as a neural network
- Associative Memory - Free recall, dream logic, the random sprout of thought

modularity is the dna of creativity. creation must be purposeful, otherwise the product is a transparent mesh fabricating what true creativity is. we are only shortly fascinated by the artifical, but we develop longings for the natural. the nautrality is the modularity that allows innovation, collaboration, orchestration. art.  modularity is not easy, modular thinking is even more diificult. one has to break their own known concepts into little cells and palce them in their most relatable space.

the creative mind is that which can break apart something and turn it into something unique. the genius mind will be able to find the connections between said modules. a creative genius can do both. everything connects- this is true. 

the ability to memorize is one of lifes greatest gifts. humans memorize stories, dogs memorize scents, trees memorize environment. 
one of my greatest fears is losing my memory- it haunts me. memory is also essential for creativity and innovation, to memorize concepts, tales, actions, etc.
i want to design a memory framework. one that works for me. i will do a study, an idea could be t memorize 10 facts at the end of each week with a different memeory practice.
i ultimately want the ability to store memories in specific cells of my mind, and those memories branch off into connections. like a fractal tree.  how can this work?
i should first identify the framework that i use now.
