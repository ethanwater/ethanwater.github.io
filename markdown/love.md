**the state::**

They call me a serial dater. I have always found myself in relationships. Since I was a young child, I couldn’t help thinking about women. Since then, I have always dated someone. Very rarely would you find me to be single, but often you’ll notice that my partners face weight and height has changed. It’s become a bit of a joke in the family and clique, “You suck at breaking up”, “You always fall in love”. They are 100% correct on this matter.

  

I have probably been in about 8 relationships now, much longer than the list of experiences on my resume. Obviously, this can be taken in two ways: either I am awesome at dating or I suck at it. Either way, I don’t care how others feel about it. But it does bring up the question of why’d they all end?

  

1. Ni...: I don’t remember, I think we got in trouble cause we were like 9.
2. An...: She wanted a 3 way
3. Sa...: Too much dandruff
4. Ka...: Too many guy friends
5. Al...: Toxic jealousy
6. He...: Toxic jealousy
7. Za...: Toxic jealousy

I’ll probably turn this into a graph or something. 

  

  

**the lesson::**

1. I don’t like being alone in terms of love since I question my own ability to be a romantic partner. I am insecure so I have always accepted love easily.
2. I let things get too big to handle. I have always been a pussy when it comes to breaking up. It can be that I feel bad for breaking their heart or for losing something that was “mine”.
3. I grow too dependent. I can find myself, cuddling in their bed everyday for months. This is no good, I have to live for me too.
