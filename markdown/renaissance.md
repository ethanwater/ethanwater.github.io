*humanitas*, is the study of humanity- the study of *philanthropia* (loving what makes us human) and *paiedia* (academic education). In the renaissance, the humanitas would be centered around grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy. The goal of this practice was to allow people to be better for themselves and for the greater good of society. Cicero believed that skill in these qualities is what creates a great leader. 

>These studies nourish youth, entertain old age, enhance prosperity, offer refuge and solace too in adversity, delight us at home, not hindering us out of doors, spend the night with us, go abroad, and live in the countryside. 
- *Pro Archia: paragraph 16*

> For Cicero, _humanitas_ was a style of thought, not a formal doctrine. It asserted man's importance as a cultivated being, in control of his moral universe. The man who practiced _humanitas_ was confident of his worth, courteous to others, decent in his social conduct, and active in his political role. He was a man, moreover, who faced life with courageous skepticism: he knows that the consolations of popular religion are for more credulous beings than himself, that life is uncertain, and that sturdy pessimism is superior to self-deceptive optimism. Man becomes man as he refines himself; he even becomes godlike: “_Deus est mortali iuvare mortalem_,” wrote Pliny, translating a Greek Stoic, “To help man is man's true God.”


The defining movement of 1400-1600 Europe. Renaissance humanists believe in working towards ones own potential for the betterment of themselves and society. The origins of the movement went back to 14th century Italy, a revived interest in the classical worlds of study, not in religion, but in those fields which explore what it means to be human (science, art, history, philosophy, etc).


The main elements of Renaissance humanism include:
- an interest in studying literature and art from antiquity
- an interest in the eloquent use of Latin and philology
- a belief in the importance and power of education to create useful citizens
- the promotion of private and civic virtue
- a rejection of scholasticism
- the encouragement of non-religious studies
- an emphasis on the individual and their moral autonomy
- a belief in the importance of observation, critical analysis, and creativity
- a belief that poets, writers, and artists can lead humanity to a better way of living
- an interest in the question 'what does it mean to be human'?

Renaissance humanism -> Individualism, Polymath

Sincere emphasis on rhetoric, The Art of Persuasion; the excellence of Cicero

As the Greeks migrated into Italy, along would they bring many ancient manuscripts. These manuscripts would become significant resources to study for the humanism movement- aiming to discover any secrets of the old. 

_“Principles for the Development of a Complete Mind: Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses — especially learn how to see. **Realize that everything connects to everything else.**” -Leonardo DaVinci_

1. **Relentless Curiosity** Encourage and flourish your inner child-like curiosity. What made polymaths like DaVinci so great was his urge to understand why something is the way it is, and to then connect that to bigger picture. This would lead into _7. Connecting Everything to Everything Else_
    
    _"But that’s the trait that defines geniuses like Leonardo: They’re ridiculously, painfully curious. They just ought to know everything. Every little object or occurrence piques their interest and leads them down an inquisitory rabbit hole. **When they have a question, they have to answer it no matter what.**" -Ann Treboux_
    
    _**“I have no special talents, I am just passionately curious.**” - Albert Einstein_
    
    Just as important, is to act upon this curiosity. Eventually, this allows those who practice accordingly- to see things that others cannot see.
    
2. **Sharp Observation** _"You see, but you do not observe" - Sherlock Holmes_
    
    Polymaths and geniuses alike practice the habit of keen observation. One must use their relentless curiosity to fully observe whatever catches their eye. Then, you must apply what you have learned to emulation- write a note on your findings, apply it to current projects, are begin new endeavors.
    
    Sharp Observation is in close ties with Relentless Curiosity as they both depend on each other to thrive. German Philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, perfectly describes the difference between a genius and someone who is talented: _"Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see."_
    
    Strive for genius, not for talent. Geniuses innovate- talent alone cannot.
    
3. **Timely Perfectionism** _"Real artists ship" - Steve Jobs_
    
    > Creating a hundred great works, is better than creating one masterpiece. This is because with every piece we create (and finish), we learn many valuable lessons from the creative process.
    
    Perfectionism itself is normally a negative approach. To goal of perfection leads to constant dissatisfaction, and stagnancy in ones creative process. Instead of aiming for whatever we deem as "perfect", we should simply put our all into everything that we do- resulting in a satisfied and prosperous mind.
    
    Always aim for your next work to be your greatest, but don't allow it to brittle your sanity.
    
4. **Emphasis on Experience** The key to brilliance isn't solely reliant on literary knowledge, but is more dependent on hands on experience. Anyone can learn a book on swimming, but that doesn't mean they are a swimmer. To become a master at a craft, you must venture outside the lectures and instead use your own devices. _“They will say that I, having no literary skill, cannot properly express that which I desire to treat of, but they do not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience rather than by words. And experience has been the mistress of those who wrote well. And so, as mistress, I will cite her in all cases. Though I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall rely on that which is much greater and more worthy: on experience, the mistress of their masters.”-DaVinci_
    
5. **Connect Everything to Everything Else** The most important realization in learning, is that everything connects to everything else.
    
    _"Science, art, history, philosophy — they’re all supposed to work in tandem. They inform and expand on each other. They fill each other’s gaps. After all, they have the same purpose: To help us make sense of the universe._
    
    _By separating knowledge into silos, we’re breaking the universe into fragments, and this way we will never understand it in its entirety._
    
    _Geniuses like Leonardo, however, know that a fragmentary approach is incorrect. There is a science to art, just as there’s an art to science. Everything is connected to everything else — and we should learn to see that connection." - Ann Treboux_
