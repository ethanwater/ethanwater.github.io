I love my bed. I love the feeling of comfort it gives me. It’s kinda like getting swallowed by a whale with good hygiene. The bed loves me too. Over the years it has morphed to my shape, knowing just how to fit me right in. However, love can be toxic. When does ones love for their bed transition from a luxury to a dependency?

  

A third of the day is probably spent in bed. Often times after I wake up, I look at my phone for an hour to determine whether a cat with a sombrero is worth my like. It’s also become ritual for me to lay down post-shower. Then there are the other times where I just decided “fuck it!” and lay in my bed. 

  

I lie to myself. A lot. We all do. Usually, whenever I lay in my bed I bring my laptop so that i can be productive in bed. This is a lie that I tell myself. Never have I ever been productive for more than 15 minutes while laying in my bed. It’s just too fucking comfortable. The sheer amount of willpower to get out of a cozy bend should not be underestimated. I find it so fucking difficult to get out of bed, it’s like a heaven.
