Memorization is one of lifes greatest gifts. We memorize stories, dogs memorize scents, trees memorize biomes. 


One of my greatest fears is losing my memory- it haunts me. I would hate to forget the things that I learn, the stories that I'm told, and the actions that I took.

I want to design a mental framework- one that enhances my memory and thought. 

I imagine mine as a fractal tree.
